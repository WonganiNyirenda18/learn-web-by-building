## INF 212 — The Nature of the Web 

INF 212 is an educational web project designed to teach students the foundations, evolution, design principles, and development practices of the World Wide Web.

## This project is both:

A learning platform for students studying web technologies

A practical course project that encourages hands-on understanding of how the web works
